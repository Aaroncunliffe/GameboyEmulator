fixed CB 0xD3 - now passes test 10

Due to fixes in the ADD16 function (to pass instruction 0x39 from the test 03) test 05 now passes.

Fixed POP AF, function F1 (See test 08 entry). Now failing DAA instruction. This one will be difficult to implement. test 01 now gets to test #6



Game and watch:

ball game, incorrectly sets active rom bank to 0x0D or 0x0A, 0x08 is the maximum it should be. 
after some inspection it seems it pops 0x9003 from the stack into the program counter and starts executing on VRAM.
0x9003 is a PUSH DE instruction executed at 0x0155.

0x0153 is actually the Vblank interrupt handler...

It happens when you catch the 10th ball, so it could be a DAA instruction issue, 
I'm going to leave this alone until that is implemented. the game seems quite playable though.

Yes this is fixed, it was the DAA instruction causing the wrong value rom bank to be read.


Duck Tales:
Each time LCD interrupt is called, the SCY register jumps from the score at the top, (Value 0x00) to the map at the bottom, (value 0x70). Interrupt occurs during mode 2.
Also toggles BG map bit on and off. 

Loads 0xC635 as the value to move into SCY

pc == 0x0248 is the instruction that writes the 0x70 to the SCY register
It never passes the jump at 0x023B
STAT LY=LYC is never active at this point

Fixed, was an error with my code to flag a LY=LYC interrupt

Enemy sprite on first level isn't visible.

When start is pressed, window should raise while the game is paused and stop at a fixed point,
the cycle is, retrieve winY -> decrement twice -> set winY to the new value. the set is at 0x4951
each cycle the value of winY is compared to 0x68, mine just loops there and winY is decremented until it wraps around to 0xFE

winX is 1 pixel off, it should be 7 but instead it is 8

Fixed both problems:
display->GetWinY() was actually returning winX. which was a typo

sprites that show the currently selected item (after selecting egg and hatching) don't show correctly. they are 16px sprites, could be an issue with drawing them.
