None of the test roms output to the screen OR write to the serial register.

Never gets past the check at 0xC084

RR instruction incorrect.


11/09/17:

- Fixed issue with RRA instruction, where it was not placing the carry value into bit 7 of the register.

- Hits instruction 0xC084 twice with the correct registers, on 3rd hit the registers are wrong

- Doesnt hit instruction 0xC0CD more than once, it should

- Fixed issue with RR and RL instructions, carry was being set to the value AFTER the shift not before.

- Fixed MASSIVE oversight, when CALLING depending on flag condition, pushed CURRENT instructions address to the stack, not the next instruction.
  - After fixing the above, prints the first character to the console window. doesn't progress any further

- Fixed SUB function did not set carry flag properly. Was comparing flags register rather than A register. (Same bug existed in other maths functions)
  - Now prints the test name to the screen and gets stuck

 NOTE: One of the above changes also fixed the scoreboard issue in tetris. Tetris is now completely playable apart from DAA instruction (scores are still HEX)
