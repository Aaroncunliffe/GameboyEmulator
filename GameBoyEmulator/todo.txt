CPU

1. All XOR instructions

2. WHY IS ADD 16 bit registers marked as TODO?!

3. Need to enable interupts on reti instruction

4. Pay attention to SIGNED or UNSIGNED immediate values -> and how this effects flags



DISPLAY



-- WARNINGS --
1. Flags may not be set correctly, especially carry / half-carry for subtracts
2. Stack may start 1 too short of the end of the stack.


How to decide which opcode table to use? CB or Normal?

16/06/2017:
- Ordering of low and high bytes, if it effects jumps?
- Be careful of missing else' to reset flags, also for missing '~', using 'big' instead of 'flag' and mixing wrong flags.
- Got up to PC 0x0322 which is CALL 7FF3. up until this point, all data matches No$gmb

18/06/2017:
- Display maps,
- Need to write to IO regs in the array as well as the specific variables inside display

09/07/2017:
- Display granted access to MMU, might not be required, display class can access its own VRAM, including display registers
